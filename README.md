ðŸš€ Power BI Project: Business Insights 360 for Atliq Hardware

I built this end-to-end BI solution from raw SQL datasets, transforming them into an executive-level dashboard experience. The project simulates real-world business analysis across multiple functions â€” Sales, Finance, Marketing, and Supply Chain.

âœ… What I did:

Queried and extracted all data from SQL, joining multiple tables and filtering based on fiscal logic

Built a clean Power BI data model with 20+ interconnected tables

Wrote 40+ DAX measures including GM%, Net Profit, Forecast Accuracy %, COGS, etc.

Performed advanced transformation using Power Query Editor (merging, calculating, enriching)

Delivered dashboards for P&L, forecasting, unit economics, and customer segmentation

Engineered 40+ custom DAX measures (e.g., Net Sales, Gross Margin %, Forecast Accuracy %, Net Profit %) and multiple calculated columns

Designed dynamic P&L dashboards with YoY/LY comparisons, cost breakdowns, and unit-level profitability

Integrated pre/post invoice deductions and SG&A expenses to analyze net revenue vs gross profit

Developed forecast vs actual analysis dashboards, exposing 52M+ units of excess inventory

Delivered executive dashboards with slicers by region, customer, and product segment for deep-dive analysis

ðŸ’¡ Result: Enabled full visibility into performance trends, forecast reliability, and profitability by region, product, and customer.
